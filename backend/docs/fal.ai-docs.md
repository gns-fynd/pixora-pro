## Using the API

### Installation & Setup
```python
pip install fal-client
export FAL_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Basic Usage Pattern
All endpoints follow a similar pattern:
```python
import fal_client

# For synchronous requests with progress logging
result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "model-endpoint-name",
    arguments={
        # model-specific parameters
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update_function
)

# For streaming (supported by some models)
stream = fal_client.stream(
    "model-endpoint-name", 
    arguments={...}
)
```

### File Handling
Three ways to provide files:
1. Base64 data URI (convenient but impacts performance)
2. Hosted URLs (must be publicly accessible)
3. FAL's file storage:
   ```python
   url = fal_client.upload_file("path/to/file")
   ```

## Example Usage

### Text-to-Image with FLUX.1
```python
result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/flux/dev",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "Extreme close-up of a tiger eye with the word 'FLUX' painted over it",
        "image_size": "landscape_4_3",
        "num_inference_steps": 28,
        "guidance_scale": 3.5,
        "num_images": 1
    }
)
```

### Voice Cloning
```python
result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/minimax-tts/voice-clone",
    arguments={
        "audio_url": "https://example.com/your-audio-file.wav",
        "noise_reduction": True
    }
)
```

### Sound Effects Generation
```python
result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/elevenlabs/sound-effects",
    arguments={
        "text": "Spacious braam suitable for high-impact movie trailer moments",
        "prompt_influence": 0.3
    }
)
```

### Image-to-Video
```python
result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/kling-video/v1.6/pro/image-to-video",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "Snowflakes fall as a car moves along the road.",
        "image_url": "https://example.com/your-image.jpeg",
        "duration": "5",
        "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
    }
)
```
