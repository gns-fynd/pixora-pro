# Building a Video Generation Agent with OpenAI Agents SDK

OpenAI’s Agent SDK provides a high-level framework for creating **tool-using AI agents**. An agent is essentially an LLM with a role description and access to a set of tools (functions or external APIs). The SDK supplies an **agent loop** that automatically calls tools and feeds their outputs back to the model until the task is complete. It also supports *handoffs* (delegating tasks to other agents) and *guardrails* (input validation) as primitives. Tools can be **hosted** (built-in search or file tools), **function tools** (your Python functions turned into tools with auto-generated JSON schemas), or **agent-as-tool** (an agent invoking another agent). For example, any Python function you decorate with `@function_tool` becomes a callable tool: the SDK uses your function’s name, docstring, and type annotations to create a JSON schema for its inputs, and returns a JSON-formatted output. This Python-first design makes it easy to define complex workflows by simply importing libraries and writing functions.

The Agents SDK is **production-ready** and very flexible. It includes **tracing and logging** utilities (allowing you to visualize agent flows and debug them), as well as an asynchronous runner for concurrent tasks. Installation is straightforward:

```bash
pip install openai-agents
```

Then set your OpenAI API key (e.g. `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`) and import the SDK. A minimal example:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant.")
result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion.")
print(result.final_output)
```

This prints something like a recursive haiku. Under the hood, the Runner engages GPT-4 (default) with the agent’s instructions and loops until the model is “done.”

## JSON Mode and Structured Outputs

When calling tools, precise JSON output is crucial. OpenAI’s **JSON mode** ensures the model produces valid JSON for tool arguments. Introduced at DevDay, JSON mode makes outputs parseable by default, but it does *not* guarantee they match a specific schema. (You typically enable it by prompting the model with a system message like “Output JSON” or by using a `response_format={"type":"json_object"}` flag in the API.) In the Agents SDK, JSON mode is implicitly used for function tools: the model’s tool arguments are generated in JSON and validated against the function’s schema.

For stricter guarantees, OpenAI now supports **Structured Outputs** (strict JSON). By setting `"strict": true` in your tool/function definition, you tell the model exactly which JSON schema to follow. In practice, you rarely need to write this by hand: the Agents SDK will format the function signature as a JSON schema, and if the model deviates, you can catch it as a `ModelBehaviorError`. In summary: use JSON mode (via instructions or API flags) to ensure parseable output, and consider structured outputs for critical schema compliance. For example, you might prompt the agent:

> *System:* “You are an agent that uses tools. When calling a tool, output a JSON object of the form `{“tool”: NAME, “args”: {...}}`.”

This ensures consistent formatting of tool calls in the conversation.

## Step-by-Step: Building the Video Agent

### Setting Up the SDK

After installing `openai-agents`, import the key classes and create your main agent:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

video_agent = Agent(
    name="VideoGenAgent",
    instructions=(
        "You are a video creation assistant. "
        "Use the available tools to gather assets and produce a final video link or description."
    ),
    # tools to be added later
)
```

Set any desired model (default is GPT-4) and temperature. Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, or pass it in code. You can run the agent with `Runner.run_sync(video_agent, user_query)` once tools are defined.

### Defining Tools

Next, define the tools the agent can use. Since the agent itself *orchestrates* video creation (not directly generating video), you’ll wrap external capabilities as tools. For example:

* **Asset Search Tools:** Find images, video clips, or music. E.g. use a stock footage API or search library.
* **Video Generation Tools:** Call a video-generation service or compile frames into a video.
* **Editing Tools:** Trim videos, overlay text/images, merge clips, add background audio.

Each tool can be a Python function decorated with `@function_tool`. The SDK infers its input schema and returns a string (or JSON) output. For instance:

```python
import requests
from agents import function_tool

@function_tool
def search_stock_videos(topic: str) -> str:
    """Search for stock video clips matching the topic. Returns a JSON list of clip URLs."""
    # (Placeholder for actual API call.)
    # e.g., resp = requests.get("https://api.videosearch.com", params={"q": topic})
    # return JSON list of results.
    return '["https://example.com/video1.mp4", "https://example.com/video2.mp4"]'

@function_tool
def generate_video_from_images(images: list[str], duration: float) -> str:
    """
    Create a video slideshow from image URLs with given duration (in seconds).
    Returns the URL of the generated video.
    """
    # (Placeholder: here you might use moviepy or an external service.)
    video_url = "https://example.com/generated_video.mp4"
    return video_url

@function_tool
def add_text_overlay(video_url: str, text: str, start_time: float) -> str:
    """
    Add text overlay to a video at start_time. 
    Returns the URL of the new video with text.
    """
    # (Example using moviepy, omitted for brevity.)
    new_video_url = "https://example.com/edited_video.mp4"
    return new_video_url
```

Above, `search_stock_videos` returns a JSON string list of video URLs (the SDK will parse it as a list of strings because of the type hint). Similarly, `generate_video_from_images` takes a list of image URLs and produces a video, and `add_text_overlay` edits a video clip. In practice you would fill in the implementations (calling APIs or using libraries like `moviepy`). Each function’s docstring helps the agent understand its purpose, and the `@function_tool` decorator wraps it into a tool the agent can call.

Finally, register these tools with the agent:

```python
video_agent.tools = [search_stock_videos, generate_video_from_images, add_text_overlay]
```

### Handling Tool Input/Output Schemas

The Agents SDK uses your function signature to build a JSON schema for tool arguments. For example, `add_text_overlay(video_url: str, text: str, start_time: float)` automatically means the LLM should supply a JSON like `{"video_url": "...", "text": "...", "start_time": 3.5}`. The SDK validates the JSON to ensure correct types. If the model produces invalid JSON or wrong types, it will throw a `ModelBehaviorError`, which you can catch.

You can customize schemas or add nested structures by using Pydantic types. For example, if you want richer input, you might use a Pydantic model:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TrimRequest(BaseModel):
    video_url: str
    start: float
    end: float

@function_tool
def trim_video(request: TrimRequest) -> str:
    """Trim a video from start to end time. Returns new video URL."""
    # Access request.video_url, request.start, etc.
    trimmed_url = "https://example.com/trimmed.mp4"
    return trimmed_url
```

This ensures the agent’s JSON matches `TrimRequest`. Using strict schemas can also be enabled by passing `strict=True` to the decorator if needed (for critical data integrity).

### Multi-Step Workflows and Tool Chaining

With tools defined, the agent can perform multi-step tasks by chaining tool calls. The Agent’s instructions should clarify its overall goal and tool usage rules. For example:

> *Instructions:* “You are a video production assistant. When asked for a video, plan steps like searching for clips, generating transitions, overlaying text, then output the final video URL.”

When you run the agent with a user query (e.g. “Create a 15-second nature video with inspirational text”), the agent will internally do something like: search stock videos → generate a montage → add text overlay. The Agent SDK’s loop will handle passing each tool’s JSON output back into the LLM for the next step. For example:

```python
user_query = "Make a 10-second video of a sunset with caption 'Chase your dreams'."
result = Runner.run_sync(video_agent, user_query)
print(result.final_output)
```

During execution, you can inspect the trace (if enabled) to see each tool invocation. The SDK automatically feeds the result of a tool call (as text or JSON) into the conversation context. This approach requires minimal boilerplate: just careful prompting in `instructions` to guide the multi-step plan.

### Error Handling and Retry Logic

Tools may fail (API down, parsing error, etc.). By default, if a function tool raises an exception, the agent will be notified of an error. You can customize this behavior with a `failure_error_function` in the decorator. For example:

```python
@function_tool(failure_error_function=lambda: "Error: could not add text.")
def add_text_overlay(...):
    # as before
```

If an error occurs, the agent receives the string from `failure_error_function` and can decide what to do (e.g., try a different tool or abort). If you set `failure_error_function=None`, exceptions will propagate and you can catch them externally.

For network calls (e.g. to external APIs), implement retry/backoff inside the tool. For instance:

```python
@function_tool
def fetch_with_retry(url: str) -> str:
    """Fetch data with one retry on failure."""
    import time, requests
    try:
        resp = requests.get(url)
        resp.raise_for_status()
        return resp.text
    except Exception:
        time.sleep(2)
        resp = requests.get(url)
        if resp.status_code == 200:
            return resp.text
        raise
```

Also monitor HTTP status codes: handle 429 (Too Many Requests) by respecting `Retry-After` headers or sleeping. The agent should be made aware of transient failures (e.g. by returning an error message so it can try a different approach).

## SaaS Best Practices

* **Modular, Scalable Design:** Build tools as independent, single-purpose modules. For example, separate tools for “search clips,” “edit clip,” “upload result,” etc. This makes it easy to update or add new tools (e.g., swap out the stock-video API) without changing the core agent logic. You can also create multiple agents (or “micro-agents”) each focused on a sub-task, and orchestrate them via *handoffs* if needed. Keep the agent’s instructions high-level and use tools for detailed work.

* **Observability and Logging:** Instrument every step. Log each tool invocation, input parameters, output results, token usage, and latency. The OpenAI Agents SDK includes built-in tracing and span recording; use these to visualize the workflow. Expose logs or metrics (e.g. via OpenTelemetry) so you can monitor how often each tool is used, the time taken, and failure rates. As OpenTelemetry notes, **telemetry is crucial** for AI agents to diagnose issues and improve performance over time. For instance:

  ```python
  import logging
  @function_tool
  def add_text_overlay(video_url: str, text: str, start_time: float) -> str:
      logging.info(f"Overlaying text '{text}' on {video_url} at {start_time}s")
      # perform edit...
      return new_video_url
  ```

  Always capture errors and unusual outputs for later analysis. Following “Instrument Everything” ensures you can audit and tune the system.

* **Rate-Limiting and API Error Management:** SaaS systems often consume external APIs with quotas. Respect those limits by implementing backoff and retry strategies. Check HTTP status codes: treat 429/5xx as temporary failures. Use response headers to schedule retries; for example, OpenAI includes headers like `X-RateLimit-Reset-Requests` indicating when you can resume. Wrap API calls in try/except and if you hit a limit, pause or downgrade the request (e.g. use a faster model or cached response). Employ a token bucket or leaky-bucket algorithm to throttle outbound calls if under heavy load. Document the API limits in your code comments or config so future maintainers understand the quota constraints.

* **Prompt Hygiene and Validation:** Validate all user inputs and tool arguments to prevent injection or abuse. For example, if the agent accepts a user-provided video script or URL, sanitize it (whitelist characters, max lengths, etc.). Use guardrails or validator functions (the Agents SDK supports running parallel checks on inputs) to block malicious content. In prompts, clearly define constraints: e.g. instruct the agent “Only use the defined tools – do not attempt disallowed actions.” Avoid including sensitive data in prompts. Consider maintaining a list of banned terms or patterns and reject or escape them. Prompt chaining and function calling help isolate user text from tool execution, which itself mitigates some risks. Always enforce **least privilege**: the agent and tools should only access the APIs and data they truly need.

* **Versioning and Testing:** Treat each agent version like a software release. Maintain your agent’s instructions, tools, and schemas in version control. Use environment variables or config flags to switch between versions. Implement automated tests: e.g., mock tools to simulate expected responses and verify the agent’s final output against known cases. Log each run with a version tag so you can compare performance across versions. (For example, you might log that “v1” of the agent was faster or more accurate than “v2” under the same inputs.) Structured logging of runs supports A/B testing and iterative improvement. Before deploying new agent versions to production, run them in staging to catch regressions.

* **Security Considerations:**

  * *Access Control:* Ensure only authorized callers can invoke the agent (e.g. through API keys or user authentication in your SaaS).
  * *Secret Management:* Store any API keys (e.g. for video services) securely (vault, env vars) and never expose them in responses or logs.
  * *Input Sanitization:* As above, never trust raw user text. If a tool uses shell commands or subprocesses (the SDK’s `ComputerTool` or custom code), escape arguments or use strict typing to prevent code injection.
  * *Output Scrutiny:* Consider filtering the final output or prompts for prohibited content (e.g. copyrighted, illegal content). You can implement a final check after generation.

* **Performance Optimization and Caching:** Video generation is resource-intensive. Cache any intermediate results: for instance, if a certain stock clip query is repeated, reuse the downloaded clip. If a user requests the same scene multiple times, cache the generated video URL. Use asynchronous execution for long-running tasks (the SDK’s async Runner or background tasks). Minimize unnecessary model calls: keep agent prompts concise. Profile bottlenecks using logs (e.g. identify which tool calls are slow) and optimize those, perhaps by using faster libraries or parallelizing. For expensive CPU-bound tasks (like video encoding), consider offloading to a microservice or worker queue. In many cases, even partial caching (e.g. caching only the initial asset search) can cut down on redundant API calls and speed up the agent.

By following these practices and using the Agents SDK’s JSON/function-call framework, you can create a robust, maintainable video agent. The agent’s instructions define *what* needs to be done, while the well-designed tools encapsulate *how* to do it. This clear separation, along with the SDK’s built-in loop and schema checking, makes developing complex workflows feasible. With careful logging, validation, and error handling, the system can scale as a SaaS copilot, reliably coordinating third-party video APIs to deliver the final content.
